## About

I am a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at Gazi University and an AI Product Engineer focused on  
**NLP architectures, RAG-based LLM systems, computer vision, and speech/ASR models**.  

I like working on the full lifecycle of AI products — from designing the architecture and evaluation pipeline  
to deploying **production-grade, cost-aware AI systems** that real users rely on. My recent work includes  
LLM-powered browser automation, RAG-based evaluation frameworks, and SLM deployments optimized for latency and budget.

📩 **Open to collaboration** on applied AI products, LLM tooling, and evaluation frameworks.

## Experience

### Data Scientist Intern – Jotform  
*June 2025 – August 2025*

- Architected an **AI-driven enterprise browser automation** system using PHP and OpenAI, following Hexagonal Architecture and SOLID principles; implemented Chain-of-Thought engines and semantic matching for self-healing selectors.  
- Built an **AI Agent Analytics** platform in Python + React processing 157K+ sessions with Celery, Redis and WebSocket dashboards, using 1,400+ real OpenAI evaluations (no mock data).  
- Designed a **RAG evaluation pipeline** with PostgreSQL `pgvector` + ChromaDB to measure groundedness and persona compliance, achieving ~90% accuracy on internal benchmarks.

### Candidate Engineer – Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI)  
*December 2024 – June 2025*

- Developed **real-time object detection and tracking** using YOLO and CNNs, reaching 95% mAP@0.5 for internal aerospace monitoring.  
- Contributed to an enterprise-scale web application using **Docker** and **.NET**, and helped design a PostgreSQL-backed architecture serving thousands of employees.

### AI Software Developer – CopeTract (Startup)  
*July 2024 – October 2024*

- Fine-tuned **Llama 3** models on AWS EC2 and SageMaker for domain-specific business applications.  
- Deployed and scaled LLM services with Docker on EC2, setting up versioned APIs and a stable inference layer for fast iteration in a startup environment.
